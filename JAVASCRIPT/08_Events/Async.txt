JavaScript(Default JS behaviour)
--> Single Threaded == Everything will get executed on a single thread
(Each operation waits for the last one to complete before Executing)
--> Synchronous == one codeblock Execute at a time 

Execution Context ==> it is Single thread 

Blocking code VS Non Blocking code 
    ||               ||
Block the flow   Does not block the 
of Programe       Execution 
    ||               ||
Read File Sync   Read File Async(other programe will be Executing Simulataneously) 
                 For DB read we doesn't want to execute other code until we get 
                 complete response from DB.So in this case we will use Blocking Code.

Browser doesn't have capability to read file 
but NodeJs has capability to read 


Js Engine ==> Memory Heap + Call Stack
